作为一名实验工作者，有时难免会遇到急需某种试剂的情况，但又不清楚哪个LAB可能有这种试剂，这时，群发个邮件就是最好的选择，碰到热心人的概率还是很大的。怎么写邮件呢？怎样表述方能得体大方不卑不亢呢？先看看下面这几个例子。

例一：
> Hi all, 
*Sorry for the spam.*
We were looking for some puromycin powder for our experiments in the lab. I would really appreciate it if anybody could help me with some. I would return the same amount back as soon as our order arrives.
Thanks

例二：
> Hi all
*Sorry for the SPAM*.
Does anyone have a ××× antibody in the lab that works well for western from human samples? I just need a few uls for one experiment.
*Please let me know and thanks in advance.*
Thanks

例三：
> Hi All,
*Sorry for the Email.* 
I need this chemical ××× for a study. If someone can spare either few grams or as solution, I would really appreciate it. We have it ordered and can replace.
Thanks

例四：
> Hello all,
Due to Harvey disrupting our deliveries, I find my self in desperate need of a decent amount of ×××.  Should you be so kind as to help me here, I will be able to return this to you around 9/7.  
*Please let me know if you can help me out here.*

例五：
> Hello, would anyone mind sharing about 20 µL of the restriction enzyme ×××? 
Once we receive our order, I can replace what I’ve borrowed. Thanks!

综合以上几个例子，我们可以总结出来一个套路，首先打个招呼，*Hi all或者Hello*；接着，表明这是一封垃圾邮件，*Sorry for the spam*，免得引起不满；下面，直陈其事，简单明了地说清楚你的目的，比如*Does anyone have ×××? / I need ×××.* 最后，表示感谢，*Please let me know and thanks in advance. / I would really appreciate it.* 当然，结尾处不要忘记再次感谢，*Thanks!*

根据这个套路，我们来总结一个求助试剂的万能公式：

> Dear All,
*Sorry for the spam!*
I am looking for ×××. If you happen have it and would like to share few grams, I would really appreciate it! 
*Please let me know and **THANKS** in advance!*
Best Wishes
